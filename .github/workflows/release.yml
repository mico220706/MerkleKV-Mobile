# Release Workflow
#
# This is a minimal release workflow that creates GitHub releases when tags are pushed.
# Unlike heavy release workflows that build binaries, publish to app stores, or run
# full deployment pipelines, this focuses on lightweight automated releases.
#
# Key features:
# - Triggered only on version tags (v*.*.*)
# - Uses GitHub's auto-generated release notes
# - No artifact building or external publishing
# - Simple and fast execution
