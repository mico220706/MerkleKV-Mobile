# Changelog

All notable changes to MerkleKV Mobile will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with strict Locked
Specification v1.0 compliance.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **MerkleKVConfig** (Locked Spec Â§11): Immutable config, defaults, validation, secure JSON (secrets excluded), `copyWith`, `defaultConfig`.
- **MQTT Client Layer** (Locked Spec Â§6): Connection lifecycle, exponential backoff with jitter (Â±20%), Clean Start=false, Session Expiry=24h, LWT, QoS=1 & retain=false, TLS enforcement with credentials.
- **Topic scheme + router** (canonical Â§2) with validation, QoS enforcement, and auto re-subscribe.
- **Command Correlation Layer** (Locked Spec Â§3.1-3.2): Request/response correlation with UUIDv4 IDs, monotonic timeouts (10s/20s/30s), deduplication cache (10min TTL, LRU), payload validation (512 KiB limit), structured logging, async/await API.
- **Storage Engine** (Issue #6, Locked Spec Â§5.1, Â§5.6, Â§8): Complete in-memory storage implementation with optional persistence:
  - In-memory key-value store with Last-Write-Wins conflict resolution using `(timestampMs, nodeId)` ordering
  - Tombstone lifecycle management with 24-hour retention and garbage collection per Â§5.6
  - Optional persistence with append-only JSON format, SHA-256 integrity checksums, and corruption recovery
  - UTF-8 size validation per Â§11: keys â‰¤256 bytes, values â‰¤256 KiB with multi-byte character support
  - StorageEntry model with version vectors, StorageInterface abstraction, InMemoryStorage implementation, and StorageFactory
  - Comprehensive unit tests covering LWW edge cases, tombstone GC, persistence round-trip, and UTF-8 boundaries
- **Tests**: 28 tests for config, 21 tests for MQTT client, 45+ tests for command correlation; statistical jitter validation; subscription and publish enforcement.
- Initial repository structure and development setup
- Comprehensive automation scripts for GitHub issue management
- Project board automation with milestone-based organization
- Complete repository hygiene and process documentation

### Changed

- Public exports updated in `merkle_kv_core.dart` to include config and MQTT client APIs.
- Established Locked Specification v1.0 constraints for all development

### Security

- Secrets never logged or serialized; TLS validation required with credentials.

### Deprecated

- None

### Removed

- None

### Fixed

- None

### Security

- Established security policy and vulnerability disclosure process
- Implemented secure MQTT connection requirements (TLS â‰¥1.2)
- Defined ACL and access control best practices

### ðŸ”’ Locked Spec v1.0 Compliance

- âœ… MQTT-only transport established (QoS=1, retain=false)
- âœ… Topic structure defined: `{prefix}/{client_id}/cmd|res`
- âœ… Size limits established: key â‰¤256B, value â‰¤256KiB, command â‰¤512KiB
- âœ… Timeout constraints defined: 10/20/30 seconds
- âœ… Reconnect backoff specified: 1â†’32s Â±20% jitter
- âœ… LWW conflict resolution with vector timestamps
- âœ… Operation idempotency and deterministic behavior requirements
