# Changelog

All notable changes to MerkleKV Mobile will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) with strict Locked
Specification v1.0 compliance.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **MerkleKVConfig** (Locked Spec §11): Immutable config, defaults, validation, secure JSON (secrets excluded), `copyWith`, `defaultConfig`.
- **MQTT Client Layer** (Locked Spec §6): Connection lifecycle, exponential backoff with jitter (±20%), Clean Start=false, Session Expiry=24h, LWT, QoS=1 & retain=false, TLS enforcement with credentials.
- **Topic scheme + router** (canonical §2) with validation, QoS enforcement, and auto re-subscribe.
- **Tests**: 28 tests for config, 21 tests for MQTT client; statistical jitter validation; subscription and publish enforcement.
- Initial repository structure and development setup
- Comprehensive automation scripts for GitHub issue management
- Project board automation with milestone-based organization
- Complete repository hygiene and process documentation

### Changed

- Public exports updated in `merkle_kv_core.dart` to include config and MQTT client APIs.
- Established Locked Specification v1.0 constraints for all development

### Security

- Secrets never logged or serialized; TLS validation required with credentials.

### Deprecated

- None

### Removed

- None

### Fixed

- None

### Security

- Established security policy and vulnerability disclosure process
- Implemented secure MQTT connection requirements (TLS ≥1.2)
- Defined ACL and access control best practices

### 🔒 Locked Spec v1.0 Compliance

- ✅ MQTT-only transport established (QoS=1, retain=false)
- ✅ Topic structure defined: `{prefix}/{client_id}/cmd|res`
- ✅ Size limits established: key ≤256B, value ≤256KiB, command ≤512KiB
- ✅ Timeout constraints defined: 10/20/30 seconds
- ✅ Reconnect backoff specified: 1→32s ±20% jitter
- ✅ LWW conflict resolution with vector timestamps
- ✅ Operation idempotency and deterministic behavior requirements
